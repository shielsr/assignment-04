# My development process
## How I went about it

The following is a step-by-step account of how I did the project, which closely corresponds with the series of commits I made to the repo.

- Brainstormed initial ideas for the assignment
- Wrote user stories and entities
- Set up the Flask application and some basic templates, enabling me to create a server and open my templates in Chrome.
- Wrote the HTML of a basic 'Create a pumpkin' form.
- Added CSS and Bootstrap to tidy up the overall site & form appearance
