# My development process
## How I went about it

The following is a step-by-step account of how I did the project, which closely corresponds with the series of commits I made to the repo.

- Brainstormed initial ideas for the assignment
- Wrote user stories and entities
- Set up the Flask application and some basic templates, enabling me to create a server and open my templates in Chrome.
- Wrote the HTML of a basic 'Create a pumpkin' form.
- Added CSS and Bootstrap to tidy up the overall site & form appearance
- Fleshed out entities and attributes, and determined what primary and foreign keys I need
- Created config.py and included secret key code
- Set up pumpkin_design table in SQLite. I can now submit the /create form and add rows to pumpkin_design table
